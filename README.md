Assembly language, also known as assembly or assembler, is a low-level programming language that is used to write instructions that can be directly executed by a computer's CPU (Central Processing Unit).

Unlike high-level programming languages such as Java or Python, which use more natural language constructs to write programs, assembly language uses a series of mnemonic codes to represent machine instructions, such as MOV (move), ADD (addition), or JMP (jump).

Assembly language is typically used for tasks that require low-level access to hardware resources, such as device drivers, operating systems, and embedded systems. While assembly language programs can be faster and more efficient than programs written in high-level languages, they can also be more complex to write and maintain due to the need to directly manipulate hardware registers and memory locations.
